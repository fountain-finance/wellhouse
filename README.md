## 🔏 Web3 Providers:

The frontend has three different providers that provide different levels of access to different chains:

`mainnetProvider`: (read only) [Infura](https://infura.io/) connection to main [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/developers/) network (and contracts already deployed like [DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code) or [Uniswap](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a1530c4c41db0b0b2bb646cb5eb1a67b7158667)).

`localProvider`: local [HardHat](https://hardhat.org) accounts, used to read from _your_ contracts (`.env` file points you at testnet or mainnet)

`injectedProvider`: your personal [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html), [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/apps) via [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), or other injected wallet (generates [burner-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/burner-provider) on page load)
